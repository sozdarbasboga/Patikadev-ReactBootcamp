        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Dostoevsky was trained to be a military engineer, but he disliked school and loved literature. When he finished school, he turned from
         the career he was trained for and devoted himself to writing. His earliest letters show him to be a young man of passion and energy, 
         as well as somewhat mentally unstable..</p>
